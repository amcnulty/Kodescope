            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>"Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep."<br>-Scott Adams</p>
            <p>Kodascope, a sextet from Kansas City is releasing a 6-song self-titled EP on May 12, 2015. Harnessing funk, soul, pop, and electronic influences, the band has crafted an album reflective of their energetic live performances. The current line-up of the band started playing shows in the summer of 2014 and was well-received by dancing audiences. Not wanting to release an album that strayed too far from that experience, the band began recording live in their West Bottoms studio in the fall. "We would basically lock ourselves in the studio and play through the songs a few times and try to capture the energy we have as a live band," says Justin Skinner, percussionist.</p>
            <p>Holing up a couple times a week for a month in Skinner’s studio, the band knocked out 8 eight songs for a full length album. "We are all album-lovers, so we wanted to put songs on this first release that fit together and have something in common thematically," explains singer Mike Tipton. The EP was mixed and produced by Skinner over the course of the winter. In December 2014, the band released "Wind Rider" on ITunes and Spotify, along with a self-produced video. "We wanted to get something out to show the fruits of our labor and that song shows a different side to our music than the dance stuff. It’s a pretty good tune for the winter months," says drummer Matt Hayden.</p>
            <p>While the current line-up has only been around for a year, the members that make up Kodascope have been embedded in the burgeoning Kansas City music culture for over a decade playing jazz, folk, roots, pop, and electronic music in various bands. The members are all active in multiple projects like Anna Cole and the Other Lovers, Monta At Odds, Found A Job, The Waldo Jazz Collective, Claire and The Crowded Stage, and Brutus. Megan Zander (Dream Wolf, REN) and Camry Ivory (Chris Meck & The Guilty Birds) lend their amazing vocal talents to the EP on a couple tracks: "So Afraid of Losing You," and "It's Alright, It's OK." </p>
            <p>The first single from the EP is "Stay In Love (2Nite)," a song born of 70s and 80s funk influences.
The band will be hosting a release party at The Brick in KC on May 23rd.</p>
